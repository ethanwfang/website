    <p class="about">
        Hi, I'm Ethan and I am a 3rd year student at Case Western Reserve University studying computer science.
        Some things I enjoy doing include hiking, 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WP9Qm_x0e0">tennis</a>, 
        violin, traveling, and playing with my dog.
      </p>
      
    <p class="about">
    My interests currently lie in machine learning research, 
    and some applications into quantitative finance. Some things I've worked on include: LLM extended generation,
    Q-learned CNN branch selection, and earnings call alpha extraction.
